## unstable_useContextWithBailout

[File](https://github.com/tienlx97/react-experimental/blob/www19/cjs/react.development.js#L1305C13-L1305C44)

`unstable_useContextWithBailout` is an experimental React hook designed to optimize context consumption by preventing unnecessary re-renders when the context values haven't changed. It is part of React's experimental features and is intended to improve performance in large applications by selectively subscribing to specific context values.

### Purpose

The main goal of `unstable_useContextWithBailout` is to allow React components to consume context more efficiently by ensuring that only the parts of the context that have changed trigger re-renders. This is especially useful in cases where large context values are used, and you want to avoid unnecessary re-renders when only part of the context changes.

### Key Features

- **Selective Re-rendering:** The hook allows components to re-render only when specific parts of the context change, based on a select function provided as the second argument.

- **Performance Optimization:** By reducing unnecessary renders, this hook helps optimize React applications, especially when dealing with large, frequently updated contexts.

- **Error Handling:** If the context consumer is incorrectly used with `useContext(Context.Consumer)` instead of `useContext(Context)`, it logs a helpful warning.

### Usage

```jsx
import { unstable_useContextWithBailout } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  // The context you want to consume
  const context = React.useContext(MyContext);

  // The select function helps filter the context values that the component subscribes to
  const selectedValue = unstable_useContextWithBailout(MyContext, (contextValue) => contextValue.someSpecificPart);

  return <div>{selectedValue}</div>;
};
```

### Arguments

- _context_: The React context object you want to consume. This should be a context created using React.createContext().

- _select_: A function that allows you to select which part of the context the component should subscribe to. This function will receive the entire context value and should return the specific part you need. This prevents re-renders when the selected context value hasn't changed.

### Example

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useState, unstable_useContextWithBailout } from 'react';

// Create a context
const MyContext = createContext();

// A component that provides the context
const MyProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState({ count: 0, user: { name: 'Alice' } });

  return <MyContext.Provider value={state}>{children}</MyContext.Provider>;
};

// A component that consumes the context
const MyComponent = () => {
  // Select only the 'user' part of the context, avoiding unnecessary re-renders when 'count' changes
  const user = unstable_useContextWithBailout(MyContext, (context) => context.user);

  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
};

export const App = () => (
  <MyProvider>
    <MyComponent />
  </MyProvider>
);
```

### Notes

- Experimental Feature: As an unstable feature, `unstable_useContextWithBailout` is not yet stable and may change in future versions of React.

- Performance: This hook is intended for performance optimization in large applications. It should be used when re-renders due to context updates are a bottleneck.

- Error Handling: If you mistakenly use `Context.Consumer` with `unstable_useContextWithBailout`, React will log an error in the console to guide you to the correct usage.

### Conclusion

`unstable_useContextWithBailout` is a powerful optimization tool for React's context system. It allows for more efficient context consumption by selectively updating only the necessary parts of the context, leading to better performance in large-scale React applications.

Please note that as this is an experimental feature, it may evolve or change in the future.
